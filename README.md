# Aromiq Tag

Aromiq Tag is a **disposable AI-powered sensor tag** designed to monitor the freshness of perishable food during storage and transport. It logs environmental data such as temperature, humidity, VOC gases, and light exposure, enabling real-time spoilage prediction.

## Features

- Low-cost, compact sensor tag
- Measures temperature, humidity, VOC gas, and light levels
- Logs data locally using an ultra-low-power microcontroller (ATtiny804)
- NFC-enabled for easy data transfer to smartphones
- AI-based freshness score calculated off-device (phone or cloud)
- Designed to reduce food waste by predicting spoilage risk early

## Project Goals

- Develop a custom PCB integrating sensors and microcontroller
- Implement efficient sensor data logging with minimal power consumption
- Create NFC data transmission for seamless user interaction
- Enable integration with AI freshness prediction models
- Build towards scalable manufacturing of disposable tags

## Getting Started

This repository will include schematics, firmware, and documentation for the Aromiq Tag.
