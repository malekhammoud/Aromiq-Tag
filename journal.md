## üóìÔ∏è July 7, 2025 ‚Äî Component Research & Selection

Today, I finalized all the main components for the Aromiq Tag.  
I decided to skip breadboard prototyping and go straight to PCB design to save time.  
Researched part availability, selected sensor modules, microcontroller, and supporting components.  
Also documented key common passives and protections needed for the power and programming circuits.
